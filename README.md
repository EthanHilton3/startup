# Cougar Clicker

[My Notes](notes.md)

Imagine Cookie Cliker but with Cosmo instead delectible baked treats. Users will click on a image of Cosmo's face to update a score of how many times they've done so. With a scores page of player's high scores, they can compete with other users to see who can be the best Cougar Clicker!

### Design

![IMG_7068](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/07745fdc-21a5-4c81-b65d-916e3ec5b590)

At launch, the user will be on the login page where they will either have to create an account or login in using previously made credentials. After succesffully logining, the user will be directed to the main page, the game page. It will have the button of Cosmo's face with a score counter above it. Once Cosmo is clicked, the counter increases. At the bottom of the page, there are the links to go back to the login page to logout or go to the scores page. The scores page will contain an up-to-date, table with the top 10 users of Cougar Clicker based on their score.

### Key features

- Secure login over HTTPS
- Clicking the icon button to update the score counter
- Scores from all players displayed in realtime
- User scores are persistently stored

### Technologies

I am going to use the required technologies in the following ways.

- **HTML** - Uses correct HTML structure for application. HTML pages for login, for the main page of cliking, and for the scores page
- **CSS** - Application styling that looks good on different screen sizes, uses good whitespace, color choice and contrast.
- **React** -  Provides login, updating clicker score, displays other users scores, and use of React for routing and components.
- **Service** - Backend service with endpoints for:
  - login
  - storing scores
  - retrieving scores
  - calling a 3rd party quote API to display random quotes
- **DB/Login** -  Store users and scores in database. Register and login users. Credentials securely stored in database. Can't access clicker or scores unless authenticated.
- **WebSocket** - Scores page automically updates according to players' scores in real time.
