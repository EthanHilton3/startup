      <p>
        Rise all loyal Cougars and hurl your challenge to the foe.
        You will fight, day or night, rain or snow.
        Loyal, strong, and true
        Wear the white and blue.
        While we sing, get set to spring.
        Come on Cougars it's up to you. Oh!
      </p>
      
      <p>
        Chorus:
        Rise and shout, the Cougars are out
        along the trail to fame and glory.
        Rise and shout, our cheers will ring out
        As you unfold your victr'y story.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        On you go to vanquish the foe for Alma Mater's sons and daughters.
        As we join in song, in praise of you, our faith is strong.
        We'll raise our colors high in the blue
        And cheer our Cougars of BYU.
      </p>
